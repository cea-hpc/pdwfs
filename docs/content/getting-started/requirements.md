This section will guide you to setup pdwfs build and runtime dependencies (namely Go and Redis).
<!--more-->

pdwfs only dependencies are:

* Go version â‰¥ 1.11 (to build pdwfs from sources)
* Redis


### Installing Go
{{% notice info %}}
Go is only required if you need to build pdwfs from sources. Since the Go runtime is embedded in the compiled library, it is not necessary to have Go installed if you use a downloaded binary distribution from the GitHub repo, see [Installation]({{%relref "installation.md"%}}).

### Installing Redis


## Installation

### From binary distribution

### From sources
To build pdwfs from source (assuming Go is installed) :
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cea-hpc/pdwfs
$ cd pdwfs
$ make
```
Binary distributions are also available for Linux system and x86_64 architecture in the [releases](http://github.com/cea-hpc/pdwfs/releases) page.

To run the test suite, you will need a running Redis instance on the default host and port. Just type the following command to have an instance running in the background:
```
$ redis-server --daemonize yes
```
Then:
```
$ make test
```
To install pdwfs:
```
$ make PREFIX=/your/installation/path install
```
Default prefix is /usr/local.


We also provide a development Dockerfile based on an official Go image from DockerHub. To build and run the container:
```
$ make -C docker run
```
The working directory in the container is a mounted volume on the pdwfs repo on your host, so to build pdwfs, just use the Makefile as previously described.

NOTE: if you encounter permission denied issue when building pdwfs in the container that's probably because the non-root user and group IDs set in the Dockerfile do not match your UID and GID. Change the UID and GID values to yours in the Dockerfile and re-run the above command.

## Quick start

First, start a default Redis instance in the background.
```
$ redis-server --daemonize yes
``` 
Then, assuming your simulation will write its data into the output/ directory, simply wrap the execution command of your simulation with pdwfs command-line script like this:
```
$ pdwfs -p output/ -- your_simulation_command
```
That's it ! pdwfs will transparently intercept low-level I/O calls (open, write, read, ...) on any file/directory within the output/ directory and send data to Redis, no data will be written on disk.

To process the simulation data, just run your processing tool the same way:
```
$ pdwfs -p output/ -- your_processing_command
```
To see the data staged within Redis (keys only) and check the memory used (and to give you a hint at how sweet Redis is):
```
$ redis-cli keys *
...
$ redis-cli info memory
...
```

Finally, to stop Redis (and discard all data staged in memory !):
```
$ redis-cli shutdown
```
