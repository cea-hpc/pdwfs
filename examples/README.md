- ```docker/```: contains dockerized examples that runs on commodity laptops (min 4 cores) with Unix-based OS (Linux, MacOS) and with docker installed,
- ```ior_slurm/```: a simple example based on IOR benchmark tool to demonstrate pdwfs usage with SLURM job scheduler,
- ```hydroC_ParaView_Joliot-Curie/```: a complete workflow example based on the 2D hydrodynamic benchmarking application Hydro, ParaView and FFmpeg, and which runs on 3 skylake nodes on TGCC's Joliot-Curie supercomputer.
