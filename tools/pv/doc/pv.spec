%description
PV ("Pipe Viewer") is a tool for monitoring the progress of data through a
pipeline.  It can be inserted into any normal pipeline between two processes
to give a visual indication of how quickly data is passing through, how long
it has taken, how near to completion it is, and an estimate of how long it
will be until completion.

- (r162) (#1532) fix target buffer size (-B) being ignored (AndCycle, Ilya
- Basin, Antoine Beaupré)
- (r164) cap read/write sizes, and check elapsed time during read/write
- cycles, to avoid display hangs with large buffers or slow media; also
- remove select() call from repeated_write function as it slows the
- transfer down and the wrapping alarm() means it is unnecessary
- (r169) (#1477) use alternate form for transfer counter, such that 13GB
- is shown as 13.0GB so it's the same width as 13.1GB (André Stapf)
- (r171) cleanup: units corrections in man page, of the form kb -> KiB

- process disappears before we start the main loop (Jacek Wielemborek)
